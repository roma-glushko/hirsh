# Hirsh

📟 Resilient monitoring system that detects utility outages in unreliable environments (e.g. IoT, RaspberryPi, etc).

## How does it work?

TBU

## Notifications

### Telegram

The primary way to notify you about outages is via [Telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots).
You need to create [a new bot](https://t.me/BotFather) and add it to a group or a channel.
