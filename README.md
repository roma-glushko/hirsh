# Hirsh

ðŸ“Ÿ Resilient monitoring system that detects utility outages in unreliable environments (e.g. IoT, RaspberryPi, etc).

Hirsh is designed and optimized for:

- ðŸ’ª residency, robustness and self-healing 
- ðŸ“Ÿ running in resource-constrained IoT-like unstable environments

## Maturity

The project is in early MVP state. 

It's being actively tested using my RaspberryPi Zero 2W under the current unstable Ukrainian infrastructure conditions.

## Setups

Hirsh can be executed in any IoT device or board computer that supports Linux-like OS and Python 3.9+.

- [Only Supported] Basic: The basic setup includes just the device.
    The device is plugged into the main electricity circuit/outlet along with a router that provides network connection for the device.
- UPS: TBU

## Monitors

In theory, you can track any utilities your home has (e.g. electricity, network, gas, water, etc.). 
However, in practice it's the easiest to track:

- network connection [Only Supported]
- electricity supply

## How does it work?

TBU

## Notifications

### Telegram

The primary way to notify you about outages is via [Telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots).
You need to create [a new bot](https://t.me/BotFather) and add it to a group or a channel.
